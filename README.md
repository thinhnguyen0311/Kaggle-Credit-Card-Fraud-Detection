# Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection

This jupyter is to create machine learning model in order to detect fraud transactions.

The problem is datasets of fraud and not-fraud transactions are always imbalanced. Any machine learning models trained on those datasets have bias towards majority classes.

Therefore, imbalanced-data handling is essential before training this kind of datasets. 

SMOTE and Logistic Regression are used in this project.

The dataset is from [Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).<br>
Because the data file is to large (143MB), it's not commited on this repository. Please download it via above link.
